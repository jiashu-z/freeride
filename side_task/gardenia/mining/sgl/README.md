Subgraph Listing (SL)
================================================================================

DESCRIPTION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Author: Xuhao Chen <cxh@mit.edu>

This program counts the number of embeddings isomorphic to a given pattern in a 
given undirected graph.

This implementation reduces the search space by counting each embedding only once.
This is done by establishing partial ordering among vertices in the input graph.
To find embeddings, we start from each vertex v, and iteratively add one more 
vertex from its neighborhood. We use a connectivity map to record the neighborhood
connectivity. Meanwhile, a matching order specific to the pattern is used to avoid
graph isomorphism test.

INPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The input graph is preprocessed internally to meet these requirements:

  - to be undirected

  - no self-loops

  - no duplicate edges (or else will be counted as multiple triangles)

  - neighborhoods are sorted by vertex identifiers

BUILD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run make at this directory

2. Or run make at the top-level directory

  - sgl_omp_base : one thread per vertex using OpenMP

RUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decompress the file and put it in the 'datasets' sub-directory:

    $ cd ../../datasets
    $ tar zxvf citeseer.tar.gz

The following is an example command line:

`$ ../../bin/sgl_omp_base ../../datasets/citeseer/graph diamond`

PERFORMANCE
