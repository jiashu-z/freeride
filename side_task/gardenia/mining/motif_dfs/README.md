k-Motif Counting (k-MC)
================================================================================

DESCRIPTION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Author: Xuhao Chen <cxh@mit.edu>

This program counts the number of k-motifs in a given undirected graph.

This implementation reduces the search space by counting each k-motif only once.
This is done by establish partial orders among vertices in the input graph.
Meanwhile, each motif has a matching order which avoids graph isomorphism test.
An advanced optimization, called formula-based local counting, is used
to significantly prune the enumeration space. Only triangles are enumerated
in 3-motif counting. Similarly only 4-cliques and 4-cycles are enumerated
in 4-motif counting.

INPUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The input graph is preprocessed internally to meet these requirements:
  - to be undirected
  - no self-loops
  - no duplicate edges (or else will be counted as multiple triangles)
  - neighborhoods are sorted by vertex identifiers

BUILD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run make at this directory

2. Or run make at the top-level directory

  - motif_omp_base : one thread per vertex using OpenMP
  - motif_omp_formula: formula-based local counting using OpenMP

RUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is an example command line.

`$ ../../bin/motif_omp_base ../../datasets/citeseer/graph 3`

`$ ../../bin/motif_omp_formula ../../datasets/citeseer/graph 4`

PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please see details in the paper.
